Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 'Adduser' will choose UID and GID values that conform to Debian policy,
 create a home directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and
 automate setting initial values for the user's password, real name
 and so on.
 .
 'Deluser' can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.
 .
 'Adduser' and 'Deluser' are intended to be used by the local
 administrator in lieu of the tools from the 'useradd' suite, and
 they provide support for easy use from Debian package maintainer
 scripts, functioning as kind of a policy layer to make those scripts
 easier and more stable to write and maintain.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 provide an abstraction for enabling, disabling, starting, and stopping
 services for all supported Debian init systems as specified by the policy.

Description: Perl module for merging hierarchies using the C3 algorithm
 The Algorithm::C3 module implements the C3 algorithm.
 .
 C3 is the name of an algorithm which aims to provide a sane method resolution
 order under multiple inheritance. It was first introduced in the language
 Dylan, and then later adopted as the preferred MRO (Method Resolution Order)
 for the new-style classes in Python 2.3. Most recently it has been adopted as
 the 'canonical' MRO for Perl 6 classes, and the default MRO for Parrot
 objects as well.

 The Class::Singleton module implements a Singleton class from which other

 spooler or system registry.
 .
 By itself, the Class::Singleton module does very little other than manage the
 instantiation of a single object.  In deriving a class from Class::Singleton,
 your module will inherit the Singleton instantiation method and can implement
 whatever specific functionality is required.
 .

 Devel::CallChecker makes some new features of the Perl 5.14.0 C API

 The features are centred around the function cv_set_call_checker,
 which allows XS code to attach a magical annotation
 to a Perl subroutine,
 resulting in resolvable calls to that subroutine
 being mutated at compile time by arbitrary C code.
 This module makes cv_set_call_checker
 and several supporting functions available.
 (It is possible to achieve the effect of cv_set_call_checker
 from XS code on much earlier Perl versions,
 but it is painful to achieve without the centralised facility.)

Description: Perl module to safely and cleanly create closures via string eval
 String eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance, Moose
 uses it heavily, to generate inlined versions of accessors and constructors,
 which speeds code up at runtime by a significant amount. String eval is not
 without its issues however - it's difficult to control the scope it's used in
 (which determines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it can
 be quite slow, especially if doing a large number of evals.
 .
 Eval::Closure attempts to solve both of those problems. It provides an
 eval_closure function, which evals a string in a clean environment, other
 than a fixed list of specified variables. It also caches the result of the
 eval, so that doing repeated evals of the same source, even with a different
 environment, will be much faster (but note that the description is part of
 the string to be evaled, so it must also be the same (or non-existent) if
 caching is to work properly).

Description: Perl module to easily merge two or more hashes
 Hash::Merge::Simple will recursively merge two or more hashes and return the
 result as a new hash reference. The merge function will descend and merge
 hashes that exist under the same node in both the left and right hash, but
 doesn't attempt to combine arrays, objects, scalars, or anything else. The
 rightmost hash also takes precedence, replacing whatever was in the left hash
 if a conflict occurs.

 This code is based on Catalyst::Utils, but was modified to handle merging more
 than two hashes simultaneously.

Description: low level cryptographic library (public-key cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or

 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

 namespace::autoclean is a Perl pragma that keeps your namespace clean by

 longer be made accidentally accessible to users outside of your package via
 method invocations.

 This module differs from namespace::clean (see libnamespace-clean-perl) in
 that it cleans all imported functions, whether or not the imports happened
 prior to using the pragma. Things that "look" like a method (according to
 Class::MOP) will be left alone.

Description: module for keeping imports and functions out of the current namespace
 namespace::clean is a Perl pragma for keeping imported functions out of the
 current namespace. This is especially important because Perl functions are
 naturally available as methods, which can complicate subclassing.
 .
 Using the namespace::clean pragma will remove all previously declared or
 imported symbols at the end of the current package's compile cycle. This
 means that functions called in the package itself will still be bound by
 their name, but they won't show up as methods on your class or instances.

Description: Perl module for minimalist role composition
 Role::Tiny is a Perl module to do minimalist role composition. Role composition
 can be thought of as much more clever and meaningful multiple inheritance.
 .
 The basics of this implementation of roles is:
  * If a method is already defined on a class, that method will not be composed
    in from the role.
  * If a method that the role "requires" to be implemented is not implemented,
    role application will fail loudly.
 .
 Unlike Class::C3, where the last class inherited from "wins", role composition
 is the other way around, where first wins. In a more complete system (see
 Moose) roles are checked to see if they clash. The goal of this is to be much
 simpler, hence disallowing composition of multiple roles at once.

 the package and the subroutine name (in case of you want both and are worried
 by the speed.)

Description: module providing minimalistic try/catch
 Try::Tiny is a Perl module that provides bare bones try/catch statements. It
 is designed to eliminate common mistakes with eval blocks, and NOTHING else.
 .
 The main focus of this module is to provide simple and reliable error
 handling for those having a hard time installing TryCatch, but who still want
 to write correct eval blocks without 5 lines of boilerplate each time.

Description: library to determine the call-chain of a program - runtime
 The primary goal of this project is to define a portable and efficient C
 programming interface (API) to determine the call-chain of a program.
 The API additionally provides the means to manipulate the preserved
 (callee-saved) state of each call-frame and to resume execution at any
 point in the call-chain (non-local goto). The API supports both local
 (same-process) and remote (across-process) operation. As such, the API
 is useful in a number of applications.

 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.
 .
 Preferred themes for cursors can be installed if desired, via
 xcursor-themes or other cursor-theme or icon-theme packages,
 configured with update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme.

 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language
 Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over
 20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
 portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping
 and large scale development projects.
 .
 Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,
 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

Description: Core Perl modules
 Architecture independent Perl modules.  These modules are part of Perl and
 required if the `perl' package is installed.
 .
 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be
 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.
 Other packages should not depend on `perl-modules-5.36' directly, they
 should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules-5.36') instead.

 .
 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X",
 "X Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R7".  The version of X used in
 Debian is derived from the version released by the X.Org Foundation, and
 is thus often also referred to as "X.Org".  All of the preceding quoted
 terms are functionally interchangeable in an Debian system.
